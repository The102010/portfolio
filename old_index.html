                <p>
                    Co-developed an Arabic word-guessing game using NLP techniques and the AraVec model. The game enhances user engagement by providing a rating system where guesses are scored based on their proximity to the hidden word, helping users refine their guesses and deepen their understanding of Arabic word associations through an interactive experience.
